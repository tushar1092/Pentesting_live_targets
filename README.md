# Pentesting_live_targets
Week 9 tasks for pentesting live targets
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking

## Green

 Username Enumeration: A careless developer mistake has created a username enumeration vulnerability. Determine which color has the vulnerability. You can use the existing username "jmonroe99" as a test. Next, figure out what mistake the developer made.
